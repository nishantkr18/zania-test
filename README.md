# Zania | AI Challenge

## Problem Statement

Create an AI agent that leverages the capabilities of a large language model. This agent should be able to extract answers based on the content of a large PDF document. Ideally, use OpenAI LLMs. If you use the Langchain or LLama Index framework to implement this agentic functionality, please donâ€™t use pre-built chains for the task. Implement the logic yourself. Please write production-grade code as opposed to scripts, as we will be evaluating your code quality.

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your solution, please provide the following:

1. **GitHub Repository**: A link to your GitHub repository where you've hosted your code.

2. **Accuracy Improvements**: List all the ways you can make the solution more accurate.

3. **Code Quality Enhancements**: Describe how you would have made your code more modular, scalable, and production-grade.

4. **Demo**: A video or demo of your program in action.

# Zania | AI Challenge

## Problem Statement

Create an AI agent that leverages the capabilities of a large language model. This agent should be able to extract answers based on the content of a large PDF document. Ideally, use OpenAI LLMs. If you use the Langchain or LLama Index framework to implement this agentic functionality, please donâ€™t use pre-built chains for the task. Implement the logic yourself. Please write production-grade code as opposed to scripts, as we will be evaluating your code quality.

## Solution:

## Overview

This is an AI-powered application designed to extract answers from large PDF documents using OpenAI's language models. The application processes PDF files, creates vector embeddings, and retrieves answers to user-provided questions. The solution is built using the Langchain framework, with custom logic for document processing and question answering.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files for processing.
- **Question Answering**: Enter questions to retrieve answers based on the content of the uploaded PDF.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Utilizes Chroma for vector storage and retrieval.
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handles multiple questions simultaneously for efficient answer retrieval.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Streamlit application:   ```bash
   streamlit run application.py   ```

4. **Upload a PDF**:
   Use the file uploader in the app to upload a PDF document.

5. **Ask Questions**:
   Enter your questions in the provided text area and click "Get Answers" to retrieve responses.

## Command-Line Usage

You can also use the `run.py` script to process a PDF and get answers to questions directly from the command line:

1. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python run.py <pdf_filename> <question1> <question2> ... <questionN>
   ```

   - Replace `<pdf_filename>` with the path to your PDF file.
   - Replace `<question1>`, `<question2>`, ..., `<questionN>` with the questions you want to ask.

2. **Example**:
   ```bash
   python run.py docs/example.pdf "What is the main topic?" "Who is the author?"
   ```

   Ensure that `example.pdf` is located inside the `docs` folder. This will output the answers to the provided questions based on the content of `example.pdf`.
